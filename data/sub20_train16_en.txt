I must confess this discourse seemed to carry in it@@ some shadow of reason and probabil@@ ity; but in the main it is directly rep@@ u@@ gn@@ ant to the chief end of nature, to which appetite dire@@ cts every anim@@ al. For that makes it desire a supply of what they stand in need of, and avoid a defe@@ ct of their proper food. Now to deny that this very thing, which principally distingu@@ i@@ shes an anim@@ ate creature from an in@@ anim@@ ate, condu@@ ces to the preservation and d@@ uration of such a creat@@ ure, being that which cra@@ ves and receives those things which the body needs to supply its w@@ ants, and, on the contrary, to suppose that such an appetite arises from the trans@@ fig@@ uration or the greater or lesser size of the po@@ res, is an absur@@ d@@ ity worthy only of such as have no regard at all for Nat@@ ure. Besides, it is absurd to think that a body through the want of natural heat should be chil@@ led, and should not in like manner hunger and thirst through the want of natural moisture and nouri@@ sh@@ ment. And yet this is more absur@@ d, that Nature when over@@ charged should desire to dis@@ burden herself, and yet should not require to be filled on account of emp@@ tiness, but on account of some affection or other, I know not what@@ . Moreover, these needs and supplies in relation to animals have some resemblance to those we see in husban@@ dr@@ y. There are a great many like qualities and like provisions on both sides. For in a d@@ rought we water our groun@@ ds, and in case of excessive heat, we frequently make use of moderate co@@ ol@@ ers; and when our fruits are too cold, we endeavor to preserve and cherish them, by covering and making f@@ ences about them. And for such things as are out of the reach of human power, we impl@@ ore the assistance of the Go@@ ds, that is, to send us sof@@ ten@@ ing de@@ ws, sun@@ shines qualified with moderate win@@ ds; that so Nat@@ ure, being always desirous of a due mix@@ ture, may have her wants suppli@@ ed. And for this reason I presume it was that nourishment is called τ@@ ρ@@ ο@@ φ@@ ή@@ / (@@ from τ@@ η@@ ρ@@ ο@@ ῦ@@ ν@@ ), because it wat@@ ches and pre@@ serves Nat@@ ure. Now Nature is preserved in pl@@ ants, which are destitute of@@ sense, by the favorable influence of the circum@@ ambi@@ ent air (as Em@@ pe@@ do@@ cles say@@ s), moist@@ ening them in such a measure as is most agreeable to their nature. But as for us men, our appetit@@ es prompt us on to the chase and pursu@@ ance of what@@ soever is wanting to our natural temper@@ am@@ ent. Now let us pass to the examination of the truth of the arguments that seem to favor the contrary opinion. And for the first, I suppose that those meats that are pal@@ at@@ able and of a quick and sharp taste do not beg@@ et in us an appetit@@ e, but rather b@@ ite and fre@@ t those parts that receive the nouri@@ sh@@ ment, as we find that scr@@ at@@ ching the skin causes it@@ ching. And supposing we should grant that this affection or disposition is the very thing which we call the appetit@@ e, it is probable that, by the oper@@ ation of such kind of food as this, the nourishment may be made small, and so much of it as is convenient for Nature se@@ vered from the rest, so that the in@@ di@@ gen@@ cy proceeds not from the trans@@ mu@@ tation, but front the evacu@@ ation and pur@@ gation of the passa@@ ges. For shar@@ p, tar@@ t, and salt things gr@@ ate the inward matter, and by disper@@ sing of it cause dig@@ esti@@ on, so that by the conco@@ ctions of the old there may arise an appetite for new@@ . Nor does the cess@@ ation of thirst after a bath spring from the different position of the passa@@ ges, but from a new supply of moisture received into the flesh, and conveyed from thence to them also. And vomiting, by throwing off whatever is disagree@@ able to Nat@@ ure, puts her in a capacity of enjoying what is most suitable for her. For thirst does not call for a super@@ flu@@ ity of moist@@ ure, but only for so much as suffi@@ ce@@ th Nat@@ ure; and therefore, though a man had plenty of disagree@@ able and unnatural moist@@ ure, yet he wants still, for that stop@@ s the course of the natural, which Nature is desirous of, and hin@@ ders a due mix@@ ture and temper@@ am@@ ent, till it be cast out and the passages receive what is most proper and convenient for them. Moreover, a fever forces all the moisture down@@ ward; and the middle parts be@@ ing@@ in a flam@@ e, it all reti@@ res thither, and there is shut up and forcibly de@@ tain@@ ed. And therefore it is usual with a great many to vom@@ it, by reason of the den@@ sity of the inward parts squ@@ ee@@ zing out the moist@@ ure, and likewise to thir@@ st, by reason of the poor and dry state the rest of the body is in. But after the violence of the dist@@ emp@@ er is once ab@@ ated, and the raging heat hath left the middle parts, the moisture begins to disper@@ se itself again; and according to its natural motion, by a speedy con@@ v@@ ey@@ ance into all the parts, it refre@@ shes the ent@@ ra@@ ils, sof@@ ten@@ s and makes tender the dry and par@@ ched flesh. Very often also it causes swe@@ at, and then the defe@@ ct which occasi@@ oned thirst ceas@@ es; for the moisture leaving that part of the body wherein it was forcibly de@@ tain@@ ed, and out of which it hardly made an escape, reti@@ res to the place where it is wanted. For as it far@@ es with a gar@@ den wherein there is a large well, if nobody draw there@@ of and water it, the her@@ bs must needs wi@@ ther and die, so it far@@ es with a body; if all the moisture be contr@@ acted into one part, it is no wonder if the rest be in want and dry, till it is dif@@ f@@ used again over the other limb@@ s. Just so it happens to persons in a fever, after the heat of the disease is over, and likewise to those who go to sleep thirst@@ y. For in these, sleep draws the moisture out of the middle parts, and equally distrib@@ utes it amongst the rest, satis@@ fying them all. But, I pray, what kind of trans@@ fig@@ uration of the passages is this which causes hunger and thirst@@ ? For my part, I know no other distinction of the passages but in respect of their number, or that some of them are shu@@ t, others op@@ en. As for those that are shu@@ t, they can neither receive meat nor drin@@ k; and as for those that are open, they make an empty spac@@ e, which is nothing but a want of that which Nature requi@@ res. Thus, sir, when men d@@ ye cloth, the liqu@@ or in which they di@@ p it hath very sharp and ab@@ ster@@ sive parti@@ cles; which, con@@ suming and scour@@ ing off all the matter that filled the po@@ res, make the@@ cloth more apt to receive the dy@@ e, because its po@@ res are empty and want something to fill them up.
